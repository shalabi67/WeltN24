"Asynchronous API Gateway".

Your task is to write a short example app: An API gateway (preferable Spring/Playframwork) that proxies two different REST end points and outputs the results into a merged (also JSON) response.

For example you could use these two endpoints:
1.  http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1 to obtain a user's data


2.  http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts?userId=1 to obtain all comments written by that user
